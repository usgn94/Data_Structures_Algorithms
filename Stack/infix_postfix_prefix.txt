Preference order:
1. (), {}, []
2. ^          -> R-L
3. *, /       -> L-R
4. +,-        -> L-R

Explanation of Left to Right Associative:
Ex: 1 + 2*4 + 6/3
*,/ have same precedence, hence we go from left to right
so we first calculate 2*4 and then 6/3

Explanation for Right to left Associative:
Ex: 2^2^3
since it is right to left first we calculate 2^3 then 2^(2^3)
ans = 2^8 = 256
if you take it as l-r we get ans = 4^3 = 64 which is wrong

Prefix: <operator><operand><operand>
Ex a*b + c
* have high precendence sor first * then +

*ab + c (entire *ab is operand and c is one operand)
*ab c +

Postfix: <operand><operand><operator>
Ex: a*b + c
ab* + c
ab*c +
